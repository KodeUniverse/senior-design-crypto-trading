## Installation

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KodeUniverse/senior-design-crypto-trading.git
cd senior-design-crypto-trading
```

## Usage
To use the models, unzip the datafiles located in the <b>market-data</b> folder, and create a folder named <b>data</b> inside the folder of the model you want to use.

Example (for LSTM):

```bash
#change dir into LSTM folder
cd senior-design-crypto-trading/LSTM
#create data folder
mkdir data
```
Extract the contents of <b>market-data</b> and move them into the newly created data folder.

Now you can run the main scripts for each model.
